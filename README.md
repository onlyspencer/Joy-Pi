# JOY PI IT - HOW TO USE IT ?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **You can only use Joy Pi It with Raspberry Pi 3B+ and 4B !**

## Hello Guys !!

--> A few years ago, I got the Joy Pi by Joy It wich is an educational suitcase with a lot of electronic sensors and components !
--> You should keep a laptop with you if you don't want to lose your time !
        
## First, Download and Getting Started

1. Firstly, you need to install any OS on your Raspberry Pi ! Personaly, I chose [**Raspbian**](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/), the easiest to use !
|-> Go on [**Raspbian.com**](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) and download Raspberry Pi Imager on your PC
        -> When installed, select your Raspberry model, the OS you want (Raspberry Pi OS for my part) and finally chose when you want to install it (SD Card)
        -> Then, put your SD Card in Raspberry Pi and let's start !

2. Connect your Raspberry Pi to Joy It by the HDMI, the GPIO and the last cable on any USB port

## Now, let's start to code

--> On the Raspberry Pi, you have 2 softwares to code : Thonny and Geany. We'll use Thonny for this tutorial ! To open Thonny, go on top left and corner on raspbian 
    icon, select coding (first one) and then Thonny.

--> Now, you are ready to code ! I was inspired by [Pascal from Gagnebin.tech](https://gagnebin.tech/joy-pi/) to make this tutorial so don't hesitate to go on it.

> **To use all of sensors and components, you need to use the switch according to the sensor because they use different ones but I'll tell you when you'll to move it !**

# I hope you'll have fun !!
