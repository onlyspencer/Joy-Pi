# THIS PROJECT ALLOWS TO LEARN HOW TO USE LCD AND ALSO DHT11 AT THE SAME TIME
# DHT11 IS LITERALLY A DIGITAL HUMIDITY AND TEMPERATURE SENSOR WITH ACCURACY OF Â±5%
# YOU NEED TO INSTALL 2 MORE LIBRARIES : adafruit-circuitpython-charlcd and Adafruit_DHT.
# TO INSTALL BLINKA, YOU SHOULD FOLLOW THIS PAGE: https://gallaugher.com/makersnack-installing-circuitpython-on-a-raspberry-pi/
# TO MAKE THIS COMPONENT FUNCTIONAL, PUT OFF ALL SWITCHES

import time # Importing time
import datetime as dt # Importing datetime
import board # It's installed with Blinka
import busio # It's installed with Blinka

import Adafruit_DHT # This library allows to use DHT11 (or DHT22 if you have it)

lcd_columns = '16' # Don't try to change it, it won't change

# Number of rows in the LCD screen

# Setup of DHT11
